                        <h3 class="title">MY WAY</h3>
                        <div>
                            <div>I am open minded and self motivated. Don't like to sit in company office for 8 hours just because It's a must. 
                           I am very responsible with my work and like when people trust me.
                            

                           <p>
                           I started as a backend developer and working with JS currently. I like to explore ES6, HTML5 api, new frameworks and technology. 
                           This website is done in google polymer because I wanted to see how it works.. (works pretty well :) )
                           </p>

                           <p>
                               My philosophy is to do something and master it, to be specialized rather than to do many things and to be average.
                               If I have the knowledge I can think more about the problem itself,
                               rather than how to use the tool.
                           </p>
                            <p>I love to know how things work.
                              So seeing me reading posts like:
                              <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/" target="_BLANK">how browser work behind the scenes </a>
                              or
                              <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/" target="_BLANK">how javascript timers work </a> , etc is a daily appearance.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              I find that writing quality code is what defines programmer in the first place.
                              To be experienced and to know many programming languages is cool,
                              but understanding what
                              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond.E2.80.99s_17_Unix_Rules">this</a>
                              means and trying to think in that way is what makes me excited about programming.
